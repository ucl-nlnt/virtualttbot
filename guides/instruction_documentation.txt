Instructions: // all data instructions are 5 bytes wide
@XXXX, where the 4 X's are the instructions to be sent to the robot.
@0000 - Stop
@FRWD - Forward
@LEFT - Turn Left
@RGHT - Turn Right
@ODOM - ask for odometry data
@STRT - start recording data
@STOP - stop recording data
@KILL - stop program
@RNDM - randomize position, -3 <= x,y <= 3, -pi <= theta <= pi 

the format of an instruction in the instructions.txt is as follows:
[@XXXX,dt], where @XXXX is an instruction and dt is a time delay (in seconds) until the next instruction is given.

to create an entry, the format is:
"label":[[@XXXX,dt],[@XXXX,dt],...]

thus, to create a list of entries:
"label1":[[@XXXX,dt],[@XXXX,dt],...]
"label2":[[@XXXX,dt],[@XXXX,dt],...]
...
"labelN":[[@XXXX,dt],[@XXXX,dt],...]

It can be noted that after each instruction [@XXXX,dt] the program will automatically log an odometry entry.
The program will also automatically use @RNDM as well before each iteration to randomize the starting position.
